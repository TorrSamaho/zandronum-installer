stInstaller.nsi is the installer's source; you'll need NSIS to compile it.
- http://nsis.sourceforge.net/

You'll also need these:
- http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL (Follow the directions carefully).
- LogicLib.nsh (Place in NSIS\Include)

Right click the source file to compile. The generated file is st-Installer.exe.
Once compiled, you're done and the EXE is the only compiled file needed.

I recommend Notepad2 v1 (not 2, which removed NSIS support) for editing.
